""" This package exports repository objects.

These objects are an abstraction layer between the ORM and the application:

    * user_repo
    * project_repo
    * blog_repo
    * task_repo
    * auditlog_repo

The responsibility of these repositories is only fetching one or many objects of
a kind and/or saving them to the DB by calling the ORM apropriate methods.

For more complex DB queries, refer to other packages or services within
PyBossa.
