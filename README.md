# MicroMappers Pybossa
MicroMappers Pybossa is an open source platform for digit valunteers assiststance to microtasking during crises and scientific researches in humantarian fields.
MicroMappers Pybossa is based on pybossa. And, some logic was updated based on MicroMappers Pybossa needs. For pybossa, please see the below.

# Installing and Upgrading

**Important: if you are updating a server, please, be sure to check the

# Pybossa
PyBossa is an open source platform for crowd-sourcing online (volunteer)
assistance to perform tasks that require human cognition, knowledge or
intelligence (e.g. image classification, transcription, information location
etc).

PyBossa was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks project
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!

PyBossa powers [Crowdcrafting.org](http://crowdcrafting.org/) and [MicroPast](http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/) a joint project by British Museum and University College of London.
